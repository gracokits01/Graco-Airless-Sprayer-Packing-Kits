## Components of Graco Airless Sprayer Packing Kits

## Replacing Graco Airless Sprayer Packings
Replacing the packings in a Graco airless sprayer is a relatively straightforward process.

If you're using the machine infrequently, replace the packings every 8-12 months.

1. **Disassemble the sprayer**: Remove the drive housing assembly and any other necessary components to access the pump packings.
2. **Remove the old packings**: Carefully remove the old packings, ensuring that no debris remains in the cylinder or piston rod.
3. **Install the new packings**: Insert the new leather and PTFE packings into the cylinder and piston rod, ensuring that they are correctly positioned and properly seated.
4. **Reassemble the sprayer**: Replace the drive housing assembly and any other disassembled components, ensuring that all connections are secure and properly tightened.
